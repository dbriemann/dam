# What did the fish say when he swam into the wall?
**dam** - A theme for the fish shell.

## credits
This theme is my personal modification of the `bira` theme, which can be found here: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/blob/master/docs/Themes.md#bira

`bira` itself builds upon https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/bira.zsh-theme and
> contains traces of nuts and code from other Oh my fish themes .
